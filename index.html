        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hey everyone, a little bit about me: I am a computer science graduate from the University of Texas at the Rio Grande Valley. I'm currently working as a Tech Fellow at CodePath and was formerly working at Blue Parrot Software as a cloud developer for a little while. I am an aspiring software engineer and data analyst.

    <h2>Work Experience </h2>
    In December 2023, I graduated from the University of Texas at the Rio Grande Valley. During this time, I accepted an offer to become a teaching assistant at CodePath for their intermediate technical interview preparation program. In March 2024, I started working as a cloud developer at Blue Parrot Software. I left Blue Parrot Software in June 2024, and in July, I began my fellowship at Headstarter AI.
